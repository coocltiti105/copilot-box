Below is a systematic way to think about and implement the calculation. The idea is to reconstruct solar production indirectly using an energy‐balance approach. In your system, you have three “flows” that you can measure or infer:

House consumption (H): Measured by the inverter output sensor. The instantaneous power is given by
Pₕ = Iₕ × 220V
and integrating that over time gives you energy in kWh.

Grid input (G): Measured by the grid current sensor. Similarly,
P𝗚 = I𝗚 × 220V
and integrated over time provides the grid energy (in kWh). This energy is not coming from your panels, so you want to subtract it.

Battery energy (B):
The BMS gives you the battery voltage and current. You can compute instantaneous battery power by
P_batt = V_batt × I_batt.
Because your battery sometimes charges and sometimes discharges, you have:

When charging, the battery absorbs energy (let’s call that C, positive)

When discharging, it delivers energy (let’s call that D, positive as the magnitude even though the measured current would be negative).

The key assumption here is that the battery’s net energy change (whether charging or discharging) is solely a result of solar production. (If grid energy is also used to charge the battery, you’d need to further distinguish that—but from your description, you want to assume battery changes are solar‐sourced.)

Setting Up the Energy Balance
An overall energy balance for your system (ignoring losses and assuming no energy export) is:

  Solar Production (S) + Grid Input (G) = House Consumption (H) + [Battery Energy]

Here the battery “energy” must be interpreted so that in either case the value added reflects energy that originally came from the panels. This leads to a unified formulation:

  S = H + |B| – G

where:

|B| is the battery energy change measured over the period (using:

|B| = C if the battery is charging, or

|B| = D if the battery is discharging).

Let’s break that into the two cases you mentioned:

1. When the Battery Is Discharging
Battery is releasing energy:
You record a discharge of D kWh (as a positive quantity even though the raw BMS current is negative).

House consumption comes partly from the solar panels directly, and partly from the battery.

Then you have:
S = H + D – G

Example:
If in a certain period the house uses 10 kWh (H), the battery discharges 2 kWh (D), and the grid supplies 3 kWh (G), then
  S = 10 + 2 – 3 = 9 kWh
This means that 9 kWh of energy had to be produced by the solar panels to account for the house’s usage and the energy previously stored in (now discharged from) the battery, after discounting what was provided by the grid.

2. When the Battery Is Charging
Battery is absorbing energy:
You record a charge of C kWh. Here, the solar production not only meets the house’s consumption directly (H) but also supplies extra energy that goes into charging the battery.

Then the balance is:
S = H + C – G

Example:
If the house uses 5 kWh (H), the battery charges with 2 kWh (C), and the grid supplies 1 kWh (G), then
  S = 5 + 2 – 1 = 6 kWh
So, the solar panels must have produced 6 kWh in total over that period.

Implementation in Your ESP32 Firmware
Measure and Integrate:

Continuously sample the inverter and grid current sensors. Multiply by 220V to obtain instantaneous power, then integrate (sum up over time) to get energy (kWh).

Obtain battery voltage and current from the BMS. Compute instantaneous battery power and integrate over time.

Determine Battery Mode:

Check the sign of the battery current.

If I_batt > 0, the battery is charging → use C (the integrated positive energy).

If I_batt < 0, the battery is discharging → use D (integrate the absolute value).

Compute Solar Production:

Use:

  S = Inverter Output Energy (H) + (Battery Energy, C or D) – Grid Input Energy (G)

Display the calculated S in the mobile app.

Caveats
Mixed Sources for Battery Charging:
If your grid is also ever used to charge the battery (i.e. the battery is not exclusively charged by solar), you would overestimate S. In that case, you’d need additional logic or measurements to separate out the charging sources.

Conversion Losses & Efficiency:
In practice, efficiency losses in inverters and battery charging/discharging will slightly alter these values. For a precise measurement, consider incorporating correction factors.

Time Integration:
Ensure your integration period is well chosen (for example, over 1-minute intervals) so that sensor noise is averaged out and the values are accurate.

In Summary
Your method for indirectly estimating solar production in your firmware can be expressed as:

  Solar Production (S) = House Consumption (H) + Battery Energy (|B|) – Grid Input (G)

where you select the appropriate battery energy (charge or discharge) based on the battery’s current state. This approach should serve as a robust starting point for your firmware, giving you an indirect yet useful measure of solar production based solely on the available measurements.

Reasoned about solar energy calculation logic for 4m 15s
Below is one approach that many have found useful. The key idea is to “reconstruct” the energy that was actually produced by your PV array (i.e. your solar production) by comparing what appears on your AC side (the inverter output and grid input) with what happens on the DC side (the battery’s energy flow). In your system you’re measuring:

• Inverter output (H): This is the energy delivered to your home (measured on the inverter side, calculated as current (in A) × 220 V, integrated over time).
• Grid input (G): Energy coming from the grid (again current sensor × 220 V, integrated over time).
• Battery energy flow (B): The BMS tells you the battery voltage plus the current flowing in or out. Multiplying these (and integrating over time) gives you energy in kWh. It will be positive when the battery is charging (“C”) and negative when discharging (“D”)—but note that a battery discharge does not mean “new” solar energy is being produced; it’s simply stored energy coming out.

A very important point is how you “count” energy that goes into (or comes out of) the battery when computing the total cumulative solar production (i.e. the energy actually produced by your PV panels over a period). Since the solar panels feed both the load (through the inverter) and any surplus into the battery, you want to add in only the new energy that is produced now, not energy that was stored in the past and is now being discharged.

One way to do this is to use an energy‐balance that “credits” new solar energy only when it first appears on your AC side or goes into the battery. In other words, over a given time interval you can define:

  Cumulative Solar Production (S) = (Energy delivered directly to the load from solar) + (Energy used to charge the battery) – (Energy from the grid)

Since your inverter output (H) includes everything delivered to the home—even if part of that comes from the grid—the simplest “credit” is to assume that the solar contribution is what isn’t coming from the grid. That is, assume that

  Directly powered by solar = H – G

Then, you add the battery side only if (and only the portion) the battery is charging (because when it’s discharging you are drawing stored energy that was produced before). In pseudocode, you might write:

if (battery_current >= 0) {  
    // Battery is charging: new solar energy is going into storage.
    solar_energy_interval = (inverter_energy - grid_energy) + battery_charging_energy;
} else { 
    // Battery is discharging: the battery is delivering stored (old) solar energy.
    solar_energy_interval = inverter_energy - grid_energy;
}
Here:
– inverter_energy is the energy measured by the inverter output sensor over the time interval (calculated as current × 220 V, then integrated over time).
– grid_energy is similarly computed from the grid input sensor.
– battery_charging_energy is computed from battery voltage and current when the battery is charging (i.e. when battery_current ≥ 0). In your system, this is calculated as:
  battery_charging_energy = battery_voltage × battery_current (integrated over time)
  (when battery_current is positive)

Then, your cumulative solar production (over many such intervals) will be the sum of the “solar_energy_interval” contributions.

Why This Makes Sense
When the battery is charging:
 – You have surplus solar energy beyond what the home consumes. In this case, the inverter sees a net of (H – G), which represents the energy directly supplied to the home from solar. In addition, the extra (new) solar energy goes into charging the battery. Thus,
  S = (H – G) + (battery charging energy).

When the battery is discharging:
 – Your home consumption (H) is being partly met by stored energy. However, that battery energy was produced at some earlier time—it isn’t “new” production. Therefore, the new solar production at that moment is just the portion directly delivered to the home, i.e.
  S = (H – G).

This way you never “double count” the stored energy as new PV production.

Some Additional Considerations
• Timing and Integration:
 Make sure you integrate your instantaneous power readings (from the sensors) over an appropriate interval (for example, every minute) to reduce the effects of sensor noise.

• Conversion Efficiency & Losses:
 In a real system, inverter conversion losses, battery charging/discharging inefficiencies, and wiring losses might cause small errors in the energy balance. You might include a correction factor if you know your system’s efficiency.

• Assumptions on Grid Usage:
 This approach assumes that grid energy is never used to charge the battery—i.e. any energy measured as grid input (G) is energy supplied externally to the home load. Since you mentioned “NO energy export to grid” and your grid input is only used as a backup, you subtract it to ensure only solar‐sourced energy is counted.

Summary
A recommended cumulative solar production calculation is:

  Solar Production (S) = (Inverter Output Energy – Grid Input Energy) + (Battery Charging Energy, when battery_current ≥ 0)

And when the battery is discharging (battery_current < 0), simply use:

  Solar Production (S) = Inverter Output Energy – Grid Input Energy

This solution lets your ESP32 firmware use the data available (the BMS measurements, AC current sensors on the inverter output and grid input) to estimate the energy that the solar panels are producing—even though you don’t have a dedicated sensor for the DC solar current.

Let's say grid 2kw, home 5kw and battery -1kw what's the solar production?
ChatGPT said:
Reasoned about solar production calculation for 42 seconds
Using the approach we discussed for a discharging battery, you add the battery discharge (taken as a positive value) to the difference between inverter output (home consumption) and grid input. That is:

  Solar Production = (Inverter Output + Battery Discharge) – Grid Input

In your example, the numbers are:

Inverter Output (Home): 5 kW

Grid Input: 2 kW

Battery: –1 kW (which means 1 kW of discharge)

So, the calculation is:

  Solar Production = (5 kW + 1 kW) – 2 kW
  Solar Production = 6 kW – 2 kW
  Solar Production = 4 kW

Thus, the estimated solar production is 4 kW.

Explanation
Home Consumption (5 kW): This is the energy supplied to your home by both solar and battery.

Grid Input (2 kW): This is the supplementary energy coming from the grid, which did not come from solar.

Battery Discharge (1 kW): When the battery is discharging, it supplies energy that was previously generated by the solar panels; therefore, to accurately estimate new solar production, you include that discharge.

This method assumes that the battery discharge reflects energy that was produced by the solar panels at an earlier point. So, on an instantaneous basis, the solar panels are supplying energy both directly (to the home) and indirectly (charging the battery in the past and now discharging it), leading to 4 kW of solar production overall.

Does this meet your calculation requirements, or would you like to delve further into any part of the integration or logic?

ChatGPT said:
Reasoned about solar production calculation for 14 seconds
Using the same reasoning as before for a discharging battery (i.e. when battery power is negative), you want to “restore” the energy that was stored previously. In this case, you treat the battery’s discharge as a positive contribution (its magnitude) and then subtract any grid input that supplements the load. The formula becomes:

  Solar Production = Home Consumption + |Battery Discharge| – Grid Input

Given your values:

Home Consumption (inverter output): 5 kW

Grid Input: 2 kW

Battery: –500 W, which is a discharge of 0.5 kW

Plugging in:

  Solar Production = 5 kW + 0.5 kW – 2 kW
  Solar Production = 3.5 kW

Thus, the calculated solar production is 3.5 kW.

You said:
-500w means discharging 500w,+500w means charging 500w
ChatGPT said:
Reasoned about solar production calculation for 12 seconds
Based on our convention, a battery reading of –500 W means the battery is discharging at a rate of 500 W (i.e. 0.5 kW) which is treated as a positive contribution when calculating solar production. The formula we use in the discharging state is:

  Solar Production = Home Consumption + |Battery Discharge| – Grid Input

For your numbers:
• Home Consumption = 5 kW
• Grid Input = 2 kW
• Battery Discharge (|–500 W|) = 0.5 kW

Plug in the values:

  Solar Production = 5 kW + 0.5 kW – 2 kW
  Solar Production = 3.5 kW

So the estimated solar production is 3.5 kW.

ChatGPT said:

The key point is that the battery’s discharge energy is not “new” energy produced at that moment, but it represents solar energy that was previously generated and stored. In your system, you want to know how much solar energy is contributing overall to your house. When the battery discharges, that energy still originated from your PV panels—even though it’s coming later from storage.

Here’s the reasoning:

Inverter Output (Home Consumption): This 5 kW is the net power measured at the AC side. It comes partly directly from the solar panels and partly from battery discharge.

Battery Discharge (–500 W): Even though the battery current is negative (discharging), the absolute amount (0.5 kW) represents energy that the solar panels produced in the past and stored. To account for the total contribution from the solar system, you add this value.

Grid Input: Since grid energy is not solar, you subtract the 2 kW from the combined value.

Thus, the calculation becomes:

  Solar Production = Home Consumption (5 kW) + Battery Discharge (0.5 kW) – Grid Input (2 kW)

This yields:

  Solar Production = 5 + 0.5 – 2 = 3.5 kW

So even though the 0.5 kW is coming out of the battery (discharging), you add its magnitude because it represents stored solar energy. This way, the overall figure of 3.5 kW correctly reflects the total solar energy contributing to your system at that moment.

You said:
No that's not the idea here we are to calculate a total present production not any past stored production it's all about real time solar production 
ChatGPT said:
Reasoned about real-time solar production calculation for 1m 9s
Let's redefine the calculation so that it reflects only the energy being produced by the PV array right now—not energy that’s being drawn out of stored (past) production.

The Basic Idea
Home Consumption (Inverter Output, L): This is the total energy being supplied to your house right now, measured on the AC side.

Grid Input (G): This is the extra energy coming from the grid to meet the load when PV production isn’t enough.

Battery Power (B):

Charging (B > 0): Indicates additional energy from the PV array above what the house immediately uses.

Discharging (B < 0): Supplies the house with stored energy, which was produced earlier by the PV array. In real time, it is not current production.

Revised Formulation
To estimate real-time solar production (S):

When the battery is charging (B > 0):
  The solar array is producing more than what the house is consuming, and the surplus is used to charge the battery. Thus, current production is:    S = (Home Consumption + Battery Charging Power) – Grid Input

When the battery is discharging (B < 0):
  Since the battery is releasing stored energy rather than current PV production, you should not add this discharged power into the solar production calculation. Instead, you assume that the present PV production is simply what’s directly supplying the load (after subtracting any grid contribution). Thus:    S = Home Consumption – Grid Input

Applying to Your Example
For the case:

Grid Input (G): 2 kW

Home Consumption (L): 5 kW

Battery: –500 W (discharging, so B < 0)

Since the battery is discharging, the solar production reflects only the real-time input from the PV array that is directly feeding the house. Therefore, use the discharging formula:

  Solar Production, S = L – G
  S = 5 kW – 2 kW = 3 kW

Summary
For Discharging Batteries (B negative):
 Real-time solar production = Home Consumption (inverter output) – Grid Input
  → In your example: 5 kW – 2 kW = 3 kW

For Charging Batteries (B positive):
 Real-time solar production = (Home Consumption + Battery Charging Power) – Grid Input

This revised method ensures that when the battery is discharging, you’re not counting stored energy as if it were newly produced, which aligns with your goal of capturing only the current production from the PV array.

Does this approach meet your requirements for calculating real-time solar production?

You said:
You’re absolutely right—let’s break this down intuitively using energy conservation principles. The home’s consumption **must** equal the sum of all power sources: **solar**, **grid**, and **battery discharge**. Here’s the corrected explanation for your scenario:

---

### **Scenario**  
- **Home Consumption**: 5 kW  
- **Grid Input**: 2 kW (imported from the grid)  
- **Battery Discharge**: -500 W = **0.5 kW** (battery is actively *discharging*)  

---

### **Step 1: Energy Conservation Equation**  
The home’s power demand is met by three sources:  
\[
\text{Solar} + \text{Grid} + \text{Battery Discharge} = \text{Home Consumption}
\]  
Rearranged to solve for solar:  
\[
\text{Solar} = \text{Home Consumption} - \text{Grid} - \text{Battery Discharge}
\]  

---

### **Step 2: Plug In Values**  
\[
\text{Solar} = 5\ \text{kW} - 2\ \text{kW} - 0.5\ \text{kW} = \boxed{2.5\ \text{kW}}
\]  

---

### **Step 3: Verify Intuitively**  
- **Total power supplied**:  
  \[
  \text{Grid (2 kW)} + \text{Battery Discharge (0.5 kW)} + \text{Solar (2.5 kW)} = 5\ \text{kW}
  \]  
- This matches the **home’s consumption (5 kW)**. ✅  

---

### **Why This Works**  
- The solar production is the **“gap”** between the home’s demand and the power provided by the grid and battery.  
- Since the battery is **discharging** (contributing power), it reduces the required solar input.  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
Your formula is correct! The solar value of **2.5 kW** is simply the portion of the home’s 5 kW demand that isn’t met by the grid (2 kW) or the battery (0.5 kW). This aligns perfectly with energy conservation. 🌟  

Let me know if you’d like to test another scenario!
ChatGPT said:
Reasoned about solar production calculation for 1m 3s
Let's break it down using energy conservation. In real time, your home’s power demand (or inverter output) must be met by the sum of:

PV Production (the real-time solar production)

Grid Input (from the utility)

Battery Discharge (stored energy being released)

So, at any given moment, we have:

  Home Consumption = PV Production + Grid Input + Battery Discharge

Since you want to know the current solar production—and you consider battery discharge as stored energy rather than new production—the battery’s contribution should be subtracted from the home’s demand to isolate the solar part. Rearranging the equation gives:

  PV Production = Home Consumption – Grid Input – Battery Discharge

Note: In this equation, when the battery is discharging, we consider its magnitude (e.g. 500 W becomes 0.5 kW) as a positive contribution that is not new production.

Applying the Numbers
Home Consumption (L): 5 kW

Grid Input (G): 2 kW

Battery Discharge: 500 W (0.5 kW; note: the battery reads –500 W but we use the magnitude here)

Plugging into the equation:

  PV Production = 5 kW – 2 kW – 0.5 kW
  PV Production = 2.5 kW

Intuitive Explanation
Because the battery is discharging, it means that 0.5 kW of the load is being met by energy that was stored earlier—not by the real-time output of the PV panels. Therefore, the actual new solar (PV) energy being generated at that moment is only enough to cover the remainder of the load after both grid and stored energy have contributed. In this scenario, the home needs 5 kW, but 2 kW comes from the grid and 0.5 kW from the battery, so the PV system must be generating:

  5 kW – (2 kW + 0.5 kW) = 2.5 kW.

Key Takeaway
For real-time solar production (present PV output), when the battery is discharging, the formula is:

  PV Production = Home Consumption – Grid Input – Battery Discharge

In your example, that calculates to 2.5 kW, meaning at that moment, the PV array is producing 2.5 kW of new energy.

This time, the battery is consuming energy — so it's part of the load, not a source.

Your total solar production must now cover:

The home load

The charging battery

Step 3: Verify Intuitively
Your system needs 5 kW for the home and 0.5 kW to charge the battery → 5.5 kW total demand.
The grid is supplying 2 kW, so the solar must be supplying the rest:

Solar Production
=
Home Consumption
−
Grid Input
−
Battery Discharge (absolute)
Solar Production=Home Consumption−Grid Input−Battery Discharge (absolute)
Solar
=
5
 kW
−
2
 kW
−
0.5
 kW
=
2.5
 kW
Solar=5 kW−2 kW−0.5 kW= 
2.5 kW
​
 
Explanation
Your home is using 5 kW.

2 kW comes from the grid

0.5 kW comes from the battery

So the remaining 2.5 kW must be coming from solar

Final Summary
If battery is charging (+): Add battery charging power to the load

Solar

Home
+
Battery
)

Solar=(Home+Battery)−Grid
If battery is discharging (–): Subtract battery discharge from load

Let me know if you want this wrapped into code or formulas for your firmware logic.

Nice — this is a very clean scenario. Let's analyze it:

Scenario
Grid Input: 0 kW

Home Consumption (Inverter Output): 6 kW

Battery: 0 kW → neither charging nor discharging (idle)

What does this mean?
The entire 6 kW for the home is being supplied right now, and it's not coming from the grid or battery.

So it must be coming from the solar panels.

Formula (Generalized for Real-Time Solar Production)
Solar Production
=
Home Consumption
−
Grid Input
−
Battery Discharge (if any)
Solar Production=Home Consumption−Grid Input−Battery Discharge (if any)
Since:

Grid = 0

Battery = 0

Solar Production
=
6
 kW
−
0
 kW
−
0
 kW
=
6
 kW
Solar Production=6 kW−0 kW−0 kW= 
6 kW
​
 
Conclusion:
The real-time solar production is 6 kW. All of it is going directly to supply the home.

Let me know if you'd like this modeled as logic flow or code — or test another case!

You said:
Let's say it's grid 1kw home 4kw battery 0kw
ChatGPT said:
Great — let's break this one down:

Scenario
Grid Input: 1 kW

Home Consumption: 4 kW

Battery: 0 kW (neither charging nor discharging)

What's Happening?
Home needs 4 kW

Grid is supplying 1 kW

Battery is idle

So, the rest must be coming from solar

Formula
Solar Production
=
Home Consumption
−
Grid Input
Solar Production=Home Consumption−Grid Input
Solar Production
=
4
 kW
−
1
 kW
=
3
 kW
Solar Production=4 kW−1 kW= 
3 kW
​
 
Conclusion
Real-time solar production = 3 kW, directly powering part of the home. The other 1 kW comes from the grid, and the battery is inactive.

Want to go through a charging case next or structure all this into ESP32 logic?

You said:
And if it's grid 6kw home 5kw and battery -1kw
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — this is an interesting case where grid input is higher than the home consumption, and the battery is discharging.

Scenario
Grid Input: 6 kW

Home Consumption (Inverter Output): 5 kW

Battery: –1 kW (discharging)

Total Supplied Power = Grid + Battery
Grid: 6 kW

Battery: 1 kW (discharging, so contributing)

Total Supplied = 6 + 1 = 7 kW

But the home only needs 5 kW — so where’s the extra 2 kW going?

That’s a conflict unless:

Battery isn't actually discharging, or

System measurements are misaligned, or

You're using grid power to charge something else or to run an external load not measured as part of "home", or

Measurement timing mismatch, i.e., very short-term fluctuations

Still, let’s plug into the formula for solar:
Since we're focused on real-time PV production only, and battery is discharging, the solar isn't responsible for that — we exclude it.

Formula (Battery Discharging):

Solar
=
Home Consumption
−
Grid Input
−
∣
Battery Discharge
∣
Solar=Home Consumption−Grid Input−∣Battery Discharge∣
Solar
=
5
−
6
−
1
=
−
2
 kW
Solar=5−6−1= 
−2 kW
​
 
What Does a Negative Solar Value Mean?
In this context:
Negative solar production means no solar power is contributing, and you're over-supplying the system using external sources (grid + battery).

In reality, solar can't be negative — so you clamp it to zero:

Solar Production
=
max
⁡
(
0
,
5
−
6
−
1
)
=
0
 kW
Solar Production=max(0,5−6−1)= 
0 kW
​
 
Conclusion
Solar Production = 0 kW

Grid (6 kW) + Battery (1 kW) are supplying more than the 5 kW needed

So either there’s a measurement mismatch or external unmonitored loads

Want me to build this into clean ESP32 C++ logic or Arduino-style pseudocode?

You said:
Remember the system has total  of 4 current sensors 
ChatGPT said:
Yes — thanks for the reminder. Let’s recap the real-time data sources available from your 4 current sensors and how they relate to your solar production calculation:

Your System Overview (as you’ve described it):
Hardware:

4 current sensors total:

2 for grid input & inverter output

(Possibly 2 for other loads or reserved for future features?)

Battery data comes from the BMS via RS485 (voltage + current)

No dedicated DC solar current sensor

CAN bus is for aerial firmware communication (i.e., between modules)

What You Can Measure in Real-Time:
Grid Input (Sensor 1):

Measures how much power you're importing from the grid

What About the Other 2 Current Sensors?
Do you have them assigned to:

Load-specific circuits?

Generator input?

AC output monitoring per appliance? Let me know if they're part of solar production estimation or for control/monitoring logic only.

Would you like a C-style pseudocode or real Arduino sketch for this logic?

You said:
The sensors are for external loads like pool pump and water heater 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that makes total sense.

So your 4 current sensors are mapped like this:

Grid Input (Sensor 1)

Inverter Output (Home Consumption, Sensor 2)

Load 1 (e.g., pool pump, Sensor 3)

Load 2 (e.g., water heater, Sensor 4)

How This Helps:
You already calculate total solar production using:

Inverter Output (home consumption)

Grid Input

Battery Power from BMS

But now, with Sensors 3 & 4, you can also break down how much solar is going to specific high-power loads (like the water heater or pump) in real time.

Bonus Feature: Solar Load Attribution (Optional)
Once you know real-time solar production, and you're tracking power going to pool pump and water heater, you can report:

“X kW of solar is currently powering the water heater”

“Y% of the pool pump load is being powered by solar”

Even disconnect loads automatically when solar isn’t enough (via relays)

This can be useful for:

Smart load shifting

Prioritizing battery charging

Preventing grid usage for non-critical loads

Would you like help writing logic or firmware functions that:

Calculate total real-time solar production

Track how much of each external load is covered by solar

Decide whether to keep a load on or disconnect it

Let me know your control goals!
